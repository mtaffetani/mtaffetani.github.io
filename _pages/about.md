What do you do with such a large availability of data if you don't know how to model the processes that generated them?

Being able to change shape or create pattern as a response to stimuli is a feature that is ubiquitous in nature, used by living systems to perform their tasks and deliver functions and implemented in artificial structure to enhance their functionalities: under this perspective the study of instabilities achieves a new light as a way to enhance new functionalities in a structure rather than a failure condition.

My vision is to create a general frameworks where scientists of different disciplines can interact towards the understanding and the design of morphing in biological materials and novel artificial structures.
This vision builds upon my existing skills which include
a) development of continuum models;
b) their implementation in numerical codes;
c) continuum mechanics, linear and non-linear elasticity and poroelasticity;
d) variational calculus and techniques of asymptotic analysis for linear stability analysis and far-from-threshold analysis.

Mathematical modelling is a powerful tool to describe the behaviour of morphable solids.
