This vision builds upon my existing skills which include a) development of continuum models; b) their implementation in numerical codes; c) continuum mechanics, linear and non-linear elasticity and poroelasticity; d) variational calculus and techniques of asymptotic analysis for linear stability analysis and far-from-threshold analysis.</p> <p>Mathematical modelling is a powerful tool to describe the behaviour of morphable solids.</p> </body></html>
